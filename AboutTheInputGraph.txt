The input graph of any path searching is stored in the graph.xml file 
in the project's root directory.

The graph is planar, directed, and weighted. Nodes have X and Y 
coordinates. You can calculate the length of edges using the 
coordinates of their start and end nodes.

Edges have an average speed property. You can travel along any edge
by at most this speed. To calculate the minimal travel time along 
an edge, you simply divide the edge's length by its averageSpeed.
